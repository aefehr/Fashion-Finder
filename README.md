# Re-Bag-It-Up
The purpose of this application is to simplify the process of searching for second-hand handbags. It utilizes Lykdat's reverse product search API to search for handbags across the web based on a photo that the user submits. The response from the API call is then filtered to return the exact or similar products on resale platforms.
